        <h1>Hi. Welcome to this page about cheating.</h1>
        <h2>This is simply about cheating and it's history and what I think.</h2>
        <h3>So simply put I have a agenda for this page:</h3>
        <ol class="rainbow-text size-biggify">
            <li>What is considered cheating</li>
            <li>Is it bad?</li>
            <li>What do I think</li>
            <li>What kinds of cheating</li>
            <li>Pros and cons</li>
            <li>How to make your own simple cheat.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>1: What is considered cheating</h2>
        <p class="p-bigger-size">So cheating by definition is:<br>act dishonestly or unfairly in order to gain an advantage, especially in a game or examination.<br>But I believe it is like hacking. Everybody is like "It's so scary you are going to go to jail hacking is illegal"<br>But by both most peoples and my definition hacking is: Making something do somethnig it was not designed to.
        <br>I mean during apollo 13 they technically "hacked" their own ship to fix the air problem. So in my conclusion on that the sterotype is very annoying and drives me insane.<br>So basically from that rant I mean to say cheating is not just bad and horrible. It depends what it does. Because the same thing
        applies when it comes to "hacking"<br>It can be illegal/bad but that does not mean the whole thing is. Because yes hacking can be good or it can just be some tweak or change to change function.<br> But it can also be malicious or bad. And on the malicious thing also does not just apply to digital.
        Another part of the sterotype that drives me insane. I mean you could call a <br>automechanic who gives your car wings a "hacker" if that was a thing. So this has been off topic but I needed to get all of that out of the way. <br>So basically the point is: Cheating is just another way of altering a game in your favor.</p>
        <h2>2: Is it bad?</h2>
        <p class="p-bigger-size">This is the part where we discuss the good parts like I last stated and that bad parts I was stating are in the sterotype and even if it is part of the sterotype that does not mean it cannot exist.<br>First of all just flat out calling cheating all together "bad" is just stupid. Everybody 
        runs in blind and then automatically follows "bad" and follows sterotype.<br>Why the human brain is flawed like this I have no clue. But anyways here is the bad part:<br>First of all cheating online in a way that ruins another players experience in a place where it is not accepted is the "bad" cheating.<br>
        Though in games like minecraft where I admit I cheat. There are "anarchy" servers and anything goes on those and cheating is allowed and that is the cheating I say is the sort <br>of thing that is kind of "good"? But then it is not exactly helping so it is a mix not-good and good. It is not 
        bad I would say. Just not good.<br>Cheating just to ruin another players experience is not even really cheating it is trolling and cheating and just being a common jerk. That is just bad there is no good kind of that.<br>But then we have good scenarios that I believe (You are subject to your own opinion) to
        outweigh the bad. But hey that is what I think.<br>First. if it is a singleplayer game and you want a high score, you want a powerup, invincibilty or infiniate health<br>Then you can "ruin" it for yourself or just make it better and easier for your experience. That is not "bad" or horrible it just makes it better
        for you.<br>So in conclusion it's not "bad" but it's not always "good" and it can be used for people to be jerks. But whatever.</p>
        <h2>What do I think?</h2>
        <p class="p-bigger-size">Simple: It's good if you only ruin it for yourself</p><br>
        <h2>Pros and Cons of cheating.</h2>
        <p>Pros:<br>1. You can achive stuff you could not originally instead of putting more work in.<br>2. Make a stupidly hard game easier for you<br>3. Make the game faster.<br>Cons:<br>1. People can cheat online and ruin it for everyone.<br>2. People can use it to make it harder on another player and make the game unfair
        for another player.</p>
        <h2>So how can we make a simple cheat. That is not one to be a jerk or to ruin it for people?</h2>
        <p class="p-bigger-size">Well we need to make rules for the cheat and follow them when making it.</p>
        <ol class="rainbow-text">
            <li>Don't make it for multiplayer.</li>
            <li>Don't make it for online play</li>
            <li>Don't make it for trolling or messing with another player.</li>
            <li>Don't make the game harder and give it to someone.</li>
        </ol>
        <h2>So I have chosen sonic mania. Please note this tutorial is for cheat engine on windows. Cheat engine should be supported by other platforms.</h2>
        <img src="Sonic mania/1.png">
        <p class="p-bigger-size">So how can we cheat. Step 1 we need to think of something we want. Lets try and give ourselfs a huge score.</p>
        <img src="Sonic mania/2.png">
        <p class="p-bigger-size">So what do we do first. First use click te little monitor with a maginifying glass that has a red rectangle around it. The software has it I did not add this rectangle. Click it and select the game.<br>Now once selecting the game use a 4-byte exact value scan as shown in my image. You want
        to type the value of the thing you want to change. For me that is my score.</p>
        <img src="Sonic mania/3.png">
        <p class="p-bigger-size">As you can see I got four results. Two of them are green so they are Base addresses. This is good when cheating as that could mean it always is that value.</p>
        <img src="Sonic mania/4.png">
        <p class="p-bigger-size">So the first base address was my score. Meaning when I reset the game I can still use it to give myself a huge score. That is it.</p>
